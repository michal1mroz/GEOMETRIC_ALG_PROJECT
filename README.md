# Trapezoidal decomposition for point location problem.

This repository contains the python implementation together with the documentation (written in Polish) of the
trapezoidal decomposition for point location problem, done for the geometric algorithm's course on AGH UST.

## Known issues

- Line segments on input need to be given as a tuple (p, q) where p is left most point 
and q is right most point.
